# Monte Carlo Simulation for Portfolio Risk Analysis

This project uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to estimate the potential returns and risks associated with a financial investment portfolio. By simulating thousands of market scenarios, we can evaluate the probability distribution of outcomes and assess key risk metrics.

## üìä Project Overview

Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful statistical tool used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. In this project:

- We simulate portfolio returns over time using normally distributed random variables.
- Each simulation represents a possible future trajectory of an investment.
- Statistical analysis is performed to summarize the results.
- Risk metrics such as **expected value**, **standard deviation**, and **Value at Risk (VaR)** are calculated.

## üîß What I Did

- Built a Jupyter Notebook to run simulations of portfolio returns.
- Defined assumptions such as mean return, standard deviation, time horizon, and number of simulations.
- Implemented visualization tools (e.g., histograms, line plots) to display simulation outcomes.
- Computed and interpreted risk metrics to assess the likelihood of losses.
- Documented insights from the simulation to help guide investment decision-making.
